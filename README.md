## 🧠 About the Project

This repository provides implementations for:

- **Searching algorithms** — e.g. Linear Search, Binary Search  
- **Sorting algorithms** — e.g. Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort  
- **Linked List data structures & operations** — singly linked list, doubly linked list, and typical operations such as insertion, deletion, reversal, merging, etc.

These implementations can help with understanding core algorithmic logic, interview preparation, or as reference code for educational projects.
